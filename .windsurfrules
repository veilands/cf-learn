This is backend for IoT project where we are using
- cloudflare workers and typescript which is serverless architecture 
- InfluxDB and Cloudflare KV to store data
- We are building a backend for IoT devices
- use curl for quick testing always add timeout to requests
- use git for version control (with github) and husky for git hooks to increment version with each commit
- we use wrangler for deployment
- we use clloudflare secretes for sensitive data
- INFLUXDB_TOKEN is a secret which is stored in cloudflare, manually added and not pushed to github and nobody can see it and you don't have to worry about it
- we keep documentation in docs folder
- we use mermaid for diagrams
- readme.md is for documentation and installation instructions
- authorization is done with API keys which we store in KV
- there is a public folder for static assets which are served by cloudflare workers
- for API testing we use API key - my_api_key_12345
- we don't use local wrangler dev server instead we use cloudflare workers, before testing we need to deploy the worker
- All validations are done in middleware and not in handler
- we use vitest for testing
